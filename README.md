Introduction
------------

Node-config organizes hierarchical configurations for your app deployments.

It lets you define a set of default parameters,
and extend them for different deployment environments (development, qa,
staging, production, etc.).

Configurations are stored in [configuration files](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files) within your application, and can be overridden and extended by [environment variables](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables),
 [command line parameters](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Command-Line-Overrides), or [external sources](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuring-from-an-External-Source).

This gives your application a consistent configuration interface shared among a
[growing list of npm modules](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/config) also using node-config.
